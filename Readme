Acer Aspire 1825PTZ Rotation
----------------------------

Simple application to detect rotation on an Acer Aspire 1825PTZ
and use that information to change screen layout.

Additionally, there is an XFCE theme, that is optimized for 
touchscreens, i.e. more padding for buttons and larger scrollbars.
You will need gtk-theme-switch (http://www.muhri.net/nav.php3?node=gts).
This script will switch to the theme and back to the same theme without
touch optimized controls.

Prequisites And Installation:
-----------------------------
You will need kernel modules installed i2c-dev and i2c_i801, 
either via modprobe or automatically on startup by adding them
to your /etc/modules.

You will need access to the i2c devices as a user. To do so, you will
need to run the following steps (as root or with sudo):
- Create a group i2c: addgroup i2c
- Add all users that can use tabletmode to this group:
  addgroup <username> i2c

To change the themes for XFCE, edit the theme lines in the file
tabletmode.

Build the i2c-rotation program: make
Install the programs (as root or with sudo): make install
Uninstall the programs (as root or with sudo): make uninstall

Usage:
------
tabletmode {start|stop}

NB: detected rotation will be correct, if the laptp is switched
into a tablet, as the acceleration sensor is in the body, not the 
screen.
