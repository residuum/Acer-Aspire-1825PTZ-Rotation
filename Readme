Acer Aspire 1825PTZ Rotation
----------------------------

Simple application to detect rotation on an Acer Aspire 1825PTZ
and use that information to change screen layout.

You will need kernel modules installed i2c-dev and i2c_i801, 
either via modprobe or automatically on startup by adding them
to your /etc/modules

Usage (as root or with sudo): 
tabletmode {start|stop}

Additionally, there is an XFCE theme, that is optimized for 
touchscreens, i.e. more padding for buttons and larger scrollbars.
You will need gtk-theme-switch (http://www.muhri.net/nav.php3?node=gts).

NB: detected rotation will be correct, if the laptp is switched
into a tablet, as the acceleration sensor is in the body, not the 
screen.
